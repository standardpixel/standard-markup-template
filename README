** Summary **
This is a markup template for creating information websites that will 
be styled with CSS. The Markup utilizes tags that will let browsers 
fall back on default styles if a style-sheet is not available. This 
means that a site can progressively enhance styles allowing CSS to 
fail gracefully. This markup is ideal for information sites and may 
not be ideal for web applications.

** Containers by ID **
  * container:
    This DIV element wraps all of the content and is used as the 
    root for all styles

  * content_**number_here**
    This DIV element is a main content section. Any number of these 
    can be added to a page with a number added to the id to indicate 
    its order within the document, in relation to the other main 
    content sections.

  * navigation
    This DIV element holds the navigation. This element is optional.

  * footer
